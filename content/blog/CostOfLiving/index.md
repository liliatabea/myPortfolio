title: Cost of Living Across Europe
date: "2002-06-21"
thumbnail: ./CostOfLiving_clipping.jpg
description: Prices and earnings vary dramatically from region to region, even within the European Union. The Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices attempts to make sense of this. The prices of roughly 300,000 products are monitored intensively, to understand the real cost of rice in Bulgaria, shoes in Luxembourg or a taxi ride in Sweden.

Working at [superdot](https://www.superdot.studio/), you often get the chance to dig through interesting datasets. We came across a dauntingly detailed [table](https://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/de/home/statistiken/preise/erhebungen/icp.assetdetail.12827262.html) based on the [Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonised_Index_of_Consumer_Prices) (HICP).

We set out with pen and paper, and sketched until a new diagram type emerged. In a way, it is a hybrid of a polar area chart and a pie chart, focusing on deviation from a group mean. With this diagram type, we can show the price for each category with the radial distance from the mean, as well as the weighting of that category with the central angle. Slices pointing inward correspond to a below-average index value, and those pointing outward represent an above-average, or ‘expensive’, index value.

We used an unusual but fruitful workflow, generating the SVG structure of the diagrams in JavaScript with [D3](https://d3js.org/), before exporting to Adobe Illustrator. Where code is better, we let D3 do the work, where the human touch is necessary, we took the job back.
